Companion block to the TimeTracker block.

For admins of a category. can only be added by an admin.


For logging to work properly, need to add both timetracker and timetracker_admin to case
statement in course/lib.php ~ lines 114 like this:

case 'timetracker':
    $url = "/blocks/timetracker/$url";
    break;
case 'timetracker_admin':
    $url = "/blocks/timetracker_admin/$url";
    break;
